# WHAT IS TIME?

TIME (Trading Intelligence Meta-Engine) is **NOT** just another trading app.

TIME is a **Meta-Intelligence Trading Governor** — a self-evolving, recursive learning organism that:
- Absorbs and learns from EVERY bot source (GitHub, MQL5, cTrader, TradingView, npm, PyPI)
- Operates in dual modes: **CONTROLLED** (requires approval) or **AUTONOMOUS** (self-evolves)
- Learns 24/7 from paid accounts, demo accounts, historical data, and absorbed bots
- Has a built-in failsafe: Auto-switches to autonomous mode if owner inactive 5+ days
- Teaches users in 6 different teaching modes (plain English to quant level)

# HOW TO RIVAL VANGUARD & FIDELITY

## What Big Companies Have vs What We Can Build

### Stock Transfers (ACATS)
**Vanguard Has:** Full ACATS integration
**We Need:**
```
1. Partner with clearing firm (Apex, DriveWealth, Alpaca)
2. Implement ACATS messaging protocol
3. Build transfer status tracking
4. Create transfer request forms
Files needed:
- src/backend/transfers/acats_transfer.ts
- src/backend/transfers/transfer_manager.ts
- frontend/src/app/transfers/page.tsx
```

### Fractional Shares
**Vanguard Has:** Fractional share trading
**We Need:**
```
ALREADY HAVE: Alpaca supports fractional shares!
Just need to:
1. Enable fractional trading in Alpaca broker
2. Build UI for fractional orders
3. Track fractional positions
```

### Tax-Loss Harvesting
**Wealthfront Has:** Automated tax-loss harvesting
**We Can Build:**
```typescript
// src/backend/tax/tax_loss_harvester.ts
interface TaxLossHarvester {
  // Monitor positions for 30-day wash sale rule
  // Identify positions with losses
  // Find similar replacement securities
  // Execute swap trades
  // Track tax savings
}
```

### Direct Indexing
**Schwab Has:** Direct indexing for $100k+ accounts
**We Can Build:**
```typescript
// Build S&P 500 with individual stocks
// Allows custom exclusions (no tobacco, no oil, etc.)
// Better tax-loss harvesting than ETFs
```

### Robo-Advisory
**Betterment Has:** Automated portfolio management
**We Already Have (Partial):**
- AI Risk Profiler
- Portfolio Brain
- Yield Orchestrator
**Need to Add:**
- Automatic rebalancing
- Goal-based investing
- Glide path management

# LEGAL & FREE WAYS TO BUILD FEATURES

## Using Broker APIs (Free & Legal)
| Feature | How to Get It Free |
|---------|-------------------|
| Trading | Alpaca (commission-free API) |
| Data | Alpha Vantage, FRED, CoinGecko |
| Transfers | SnapTrade (aggregates 20+ brokers) |
| DeFi | Direct blockchain integration |

## Clearing Firm Partnerships
Instead of becoming a broker-dealer ($$$), partner with:
- **Alpaca** — Already integrated, supports fractional
- **DriveWealth** — Powers Cash App, Revolut
- **Apex** — Powers Webull, M1 Finance

## Regulatory Considerations
| Activity | Requirement | Our Solution |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Trading Advice | RIA Registration | Disclaimer: Educational only |
| Money Transmission | State licenses | Use TIME Pay partner banks |
| Securities | Broker-Dealer | Use clearing firm partnerships |

- ✅ Rate limiting (5 attempts, 15-min lockout)
- ✅ Helmet.js security headers
- ✅ **2FA/MFA (TOTP with speakeasy)**
- ✅ **API Key Management (create, revoke, rotate)**
- ✅ **Audit Logging (all security events)**
- ✅ **Session Management (Redis-backed)**

## Security Files (All Implemented)

2. Penetration testing
3. SOC 2 compliance preparation
4. Security documentation
```

# AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS

## When User Asks to Build Something New

### Step 1: Check if it exists
Look in these locations:
- `src/backend/engines/` — Core intelligence
- `src/backend/bots/` — Bot systems
- `src/backend/brokers/` — Broker integrations
- `src/backend/routes/` — API endpoints
- `frontend/src/app/` — UI pages

### Step 2: Check existing capabilities
Read these files:
- `COPILOT1.md` — Complete feature catalog
- `TIMEBEUNUS_FINANCIAL.md` — Financial knowledge base
- `TIME_NEXT_PHASE_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Future systems

### Step 3: Build in the right location
```
New engine → src/backend/engines/[name]_engine.ts
New bot system → src/backend/bots/[name].ts
New broker → src/backend/brokers/[name]_broker.ts
New API routes → src/backend/routes/[name].ts
New frontend page → frontend/src/app/[name]/page.tsx
```

### Step 4: Update documentation
After building, update:
- `COPILOT1.md` — Add feature to changelog
- `TIMEBEUNUS.md` — Update status table
- `TIME_TODO.md` — Mark tasks complete

# NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN SYSTEMS TO BUILD

## Revolutionary Ideas (Industry Firsts)

### 1. Social Proof Trading
```
See WHAT other users are buying (anonymized)
Not WHO, but aggregate flow data
Like "85% of users buying AAPL today"
```

### 2. AI Trade Explainer
```
Every trade gets a plain-English explanation
"We bought AAPL because momentum is strong"
"We sold because earnings missed estimates"
```

### 3. Time Machine Backtesting
```
"What if I invested $10k in 2008?"
Visual replay with narration
See exactly what happened
```

### 4. Sentiment Velocity Trading
```
Track RATE OF CHANGE of sentiment
Not just "bullish" but "getting more bullish"
Lead indicator for reversals
```

### 5. Dark Pool Flow Reconstruction
```
Reverse engineer institutional activity
From public data (odd-lots, VWAP deviation)
See what big money is doing
```

### 6. Life-Aware Investing
```
Connect investments to life events
Buying a house? Adjust risk
Having a baby? Increase insurance allocation
```

### 7. Collective Intelligence Network
```
All TIME instances share anonymized learnings
Strategies that work get propagated
Privacy-preserving swarm intelligence
```

# REMEMBER

> TIME is not just a trading platform. It's a **meta-intelligence** that learns, evolves, and grows smarter every day. Our goal is to give everyday people access to the same tools and strategies that hedge funds and institutions use — but in plain English, with safety guardrails, and at minimal cost.
