## Invented Systems Queue

New systems to be invented by Claude:

1. 🟡 Ensemble Harmony Detector — Detects when bots in an ensemble are in agreement vs conflict
2. 🟡 Strategy DNA Mapper — Maps the "genetic" structure of strategies for crossbreeding
3. 🟡 Market Mood Ring — Visual indicator of overall market sentiment
4. 🟡 Bot Confidence Meter — Real-time confidence level of each bot's signals
5. 🟡 Regime Transition Predictor — Predicts upcoming regime changes
6. 🟡 Learning Velocity Tracker — Tracks how fast TIME is learning
7. 🟡 Strategy Graveyard — Archive of retired strategies with lessons learned
8. 🟡 Signal Conflict Resolver — Resolves conflicting signals from multiple bots
9. 🟡 Performance Attribution Matrix — Multi-dimensional attribution analysis
10. 🟡 Auto-Documentation Engine — Automatically documents new code and systems

---

## Notes

- All tasks should be logged in COPILOT1.md when completed
- New invented systems should be added to this queue
- Priority can be adjusted based on dependencies
- Phase numbers are guides, not strict sequences
